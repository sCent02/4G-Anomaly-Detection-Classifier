# 4G Anomaly Detection Classifier

### Introduction:
The purpose of this homework is to solve a classification problem proposed as a competition in the Kaggle InClass platform. You can apply any of the concepts and techniques studied in class for exploratory data analysis, feature selection and classification.

### Problem Description:
1. Context: Traditionally, the design of a cellular network focuses on the optimization of energy and resources that guarantees a smooth operation even during peak hours (i.e. periods with higher traffic load).
1. However, this implies that cells are most of the time overprovisioned of radio resources.
1. Next generation cellular networks ask for a dynamic management and configuration in order to adapt to the varying user demands in the most efficient way with regards to energy savings and utilization of frequency resources.
1. If the network operator were capable of anticipating to those variations in the usersâ€™ traffic demands, a more efficient management of the scarce (and expensive) network resources would be possible.
1. Current research in mobile networks looks upon Machine Learning (ML) techniques to help manage those resources. In this case, you will explore the possibilities of ML to detect abnormal behaviors in the utilization of the network that would motivate a change in the configuration of the base station.

### Dataset:
> The dataset is obtained in this [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/anomaly-detection-in-4g-cellular-networks) or you can refer to this [link](sCent02/4G-Anomaly-Detection-Classifier/blob/main/ML-MATT-CompetitionQT2021_train.csv) if you want to download the csv file directly.

### The Problem:
These following are the reasons why I choose this project:
1. There is a need to incorporate machine learning in classfying the cellular network unusual behavior.
2. There is an existing gap in determining the unusual network behaviour of an existing network based from factors such as level of resource utilization in each cell, average carried traffic, maximum carried traffic, average number of user equipment and maximum number of user equipment.

### Objectives:
The following are the expected outcome of the project:
1. Determine the causation of unusual network behaviour with a given factors.
2. Build a supervised machine learning classifier model to predict the unusual network behaviour.
