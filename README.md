# 4G Anomaly Detection Classifier
The purpose of this homework is to solve a classification problem proposed as a competition in the Kaggle InClass platform. You can apply any of the concepts and techniques studied in class for exploratory data analysis, feature selection and classification.

## Problem Description:
1. Context: Traditionally, the design of a cellular network focuses on the optimization of energy and resources that guarantees a smooth operation even during peak hours (i.e. periods with higher traffic load).
1. However, this implies that cells are most of the time overprovisioned of radio resources.
1. Next generation cellular networks ask for a dynamic management and configuration in order to adapt to the varying user demands in the most efficient way with regards to energy savings and utilization of frequency resources.
1. If the network operator were capable of anticipating to those variations in the usersâ€™ traffic demands, a more efficient management of the scarce (and expensive) network resources would be possible.
1. Current research in mobile networks looks upon Machine Learning (ML) techniques to help manage those resources. In this case, you will explore the possibilities of ML to detect abnormal behaviors in the utilization of the network that would motivate a change in the configuration of the base station.

### Dataset:
